// A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
//It helps to divide a large program into smaller, manageable and reusable parts.
//Function = A small program inside a big program that performs one particular task.

// why use function
//Code become easier to read and debug. 
//Avoids repetition (code reuse).
//Makes program modular and structured.
//Helps in teamwork (each person can handle one function).

//Types 
// 1. Built-in functions--> predefined in C++ --> sqrt(), pow(), cout.
// 2. User-defined functions --> written by programmer  --> addNumber

//SYNTAX:
// return_type function_name(parameters) {
//     //function body
// }

//Example 

    int add(int a, int b){
        return a + b;
    }
